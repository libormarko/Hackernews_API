## Setup and Run

To run the app on your local machine, do following steps:
1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:libormarko/Hackernews_API.git`
2. Set current directory to be the project's directory: `cd Hackernews_API`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. The app runs on your [localhost](http://localhost:3000/).

I also deployed the app on Heroku, so you can try it right ahead [here](https://api-project-hackernews.herokuapp.com/).
